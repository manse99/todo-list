This code provides a simple command-line interface to add, complete, and list tasks in a to-do list. It uses a list (tasks) to store the tasks, and 
provides functions to add tasks (add_task), complete tasks (complete_task), 
and list the tasks (list_tasks). The code runs in an infinite loop that repeatedly 
prompts the user for a command and performs the corresponding action, 
until the user enters the "exit" command.
